//! Generator methods for pattern creation
//!
//! NOTE: The generator method implementations (chord, scale, arpeggiate, etc.) are NOT defined
//! in the generative module. They are implemented in separate files:
//! - chords.rs: chord, chord_inverted, chord_voice_lead, chord_over_bass, chords, chords_from
//! - (other generator methods may be in other module files)
//!
//! This file exists as a placeholder for potential future refactoring where those methods
//! could be moved here if needed.


// Generator method implementations would go here, but they are currently in other module files
